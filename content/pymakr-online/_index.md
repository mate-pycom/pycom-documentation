## What is Pymakr Online?

Pymakr Online is an online IDE for your MicroPython projects. We brought our Pymakr Plugin for Atom and Visual Studio code into Pybytes as an IDE, so you won't necessarily need to have those code editors installed anymore in order to work with your Pycom devices.

## What does Pymakr Online offer you?

* Everything you would expect from a code editor: syntax highlighting, auto complete, multi tabs, file tree, search box etc.
* REPL terminal
* Import from multiple sources (blank/device/project/Github repository), export to a zip file/device/project
* Device activity indicator: track what's going between Pymakr Online and your device.
